# Visualization

In this folder are created JSON files that are useful for the construction 
of [Hop Suisse!](https://hopsuisse.github.io) website. 

* [`races_visualization.ipynb`](races_visualization.ipynb) Each JSON file 
corresponds to a specific race and contains all the necessary infomation 
about it. Those files can be found in the [`races`](races) folder.

* [`runners_visualization.ipynb`](runners_visualization.ipynb) Each JSON file 
corresponds to a specific runner and contains all the necessary infomation 
about him/her. Those files can only be found in [this website folder](https://github.com/hopsuisse/hopsuisse.github.io/tree/master/runnerdata) 
since they are more that 500'000 of them. 

* [`racesnames.json`](racesnames.json) and [`runnersnames.json`](runnersnames.json)
contain the correspondences between the races' and runners' real names (respectively), 
and the corresponding JSON file names.
