# Video Animation

## The result [has been uploaded to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyvbnOXHShw).

The aim of this part is to create a short video to visualize the huge Datasport dataset 
in a concise way. We inspired to the famous [Hans Rosling's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo)

We plotted 6 variables:
- **Pace** - y axis
- **Percentage of new runners on the total** - x axis
- **Age of the runner** - time
- **Race lenght** - spheres
- **Sex** - spheres color
- **Number of runners** - sphere size

In the notebook [_video\_animation.ipynb_](https://github.com/ggrrll/hop_suisse_ada_project_public/blob/master/8-video/video_animation.ipynb)
you can find the steps that we followed to build the video.
