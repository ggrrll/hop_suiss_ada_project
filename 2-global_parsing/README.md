# Global parsing

In [this notebook](global_parsing.ipynb), we extract the global information about all the competitions 
we want to analyse. We are interested in all the running races, only in 
Switzerland. We want to extract the following information on the data:

* date of the race,

* name of the race,

* place where the race has been organised,

* URL of the page where the rankings are given.
